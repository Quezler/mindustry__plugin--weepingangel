Pauses the server by setting the editor rule to true while there is no one online.

Caveats:

- not "compatible" with actual servers that intend to run editor mode 24/7
- first player spawns in the center of the map when joining
- first player spawns with low health
- shows as editor in the server list
- removing this plugin while no one is online could lock a save into editor state
- <insert 2nd mention that this is a poor way of doing it here>
- bugs/exploits?
- probably more
